## Competitive Analysis

### **Direct Competitors (Timeline/Chronology Games)**
- **Chronology (boardgame):** Ranks #1 for "chronology game" (low KD = easy to overtake with content)
- **Timelines.app:** No blog, weak SEO (opportunity to dominate content space)

### **Indirect Competitors (Daily Puzzle Aggregators)**
- **NYT Games:** Ranks for "daily puzzle games" but doesn't cover chronology specifically
- **Wordle copycats:** Dominate "games like wordle" but often low-quality listicles (opportunity for better content)

**Strategy:** Own the **chronology/timeline niche** (Tier 1 posts), then expand into broader puzzle space (Tier 2).
